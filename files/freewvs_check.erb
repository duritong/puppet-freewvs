Hi admins of <%= @host %>

We found the following scripts with security vulnerabilities on your website:

<% @folders.each do |folder,info| %>
  * The folder <%= folder %> is part of the outdated version <%= info[:version] %> 
    of <%= info[:app] %> which at least is affected by security issue <%= info[:cve] %>.
<% end %>

Please update thoese installations to the newest version.
Or delete the folders if you don't need them anymore.

Thanks for your help
